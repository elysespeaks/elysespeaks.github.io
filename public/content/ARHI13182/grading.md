# Grading & Evaluation

### Assignments  

The course grade is based on papers, presentations, and participation.

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Five short **visual-analysis papers** (1–2 pp. each) – first draft, peer review, final draft | **25 %** |
| **Annotated bibliography** (for final paper) | **5 %** |
| **Final research paper** (8–9 pp. text + notes, images) | **30 %** |
| **Participation** (attendance & discussion) | **25 %** |
| **Semester presentations** (pairs) | **7 %** |
| **Final in-class presentation** (10 min) | **8 %** |

Late papers lose **5 pts/day**. Incomplete drafts count as late.

### How to Excel  

- Attend & participate actively.  
- **Take notes by hand** (museum policy: pencil only).  
- Do the readings before class.  
- Budget ~6–9 hrs/week outside class.  
- Start assignments early; proofread final printouts.  
- Use the **Writing Center** and **Presenter Center**.  
- International students: consider **CSLC EAP** support.

### Honor Code & AI Policy  

All work must follow the Notre Dame Academic Code of Honor (“I will not participate in or tolerate academic dishonesty”). **Generative-AI tools are prohibited** for this course; use will result in failing the assignment (second offense = course failure). See <http://honorcode.nd.edu>.
