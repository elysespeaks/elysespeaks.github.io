### Topic

_First-year students only._  
In this seminar we study and write about a wide range of works of art in local museums. Focus objects span the history of art and include painting, photography, sculpture, prints and more, produced in the Americas, Africa, and Europe. Class meetings center on close looking, historical context, and discussion of readings and writing assignments. Written work consists of several short papers and a longer research paper submitted at semester’s end.  
**Credits:** 3

### Format

Attendance is required; after **two** absences a written excuse (or prior arrangement) is needed. The course is run as a seminar, so informed discussion is essential. Everyone is encouraged to speak, ask questions, and share visual observations. I may call on students randomly to keep the conversation broad.

> **Museum days** – Some sessions meet at the Raclin Murphy Museum or other locations. On those days go **directly to the site** and allow extra travel time.

All readings are supplied as PDFs (linked on the syllabus page). **Bring them to class.** Printed copies are preferred; tablets/laptops are acceptable if necessary. Page-ranges on the syllabus override the PDF’s length.

The course site is your day-to-day guide: it’s a *live syllabus* that can evolve, so check it **daily** for updates.
